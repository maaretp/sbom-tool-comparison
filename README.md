# sbom-tool-comparison

There is a general need of selecting what of the many SBOM generating tools we would want to use for docker images. Are they the same? I set to find out by comparing.

## Prerequisites

* Install syft, grype, docker (incl docker scout) on the computer you want to run this in

## To Do

* syft identifies stuff outside intended scope as components in the script
* Compare to upstream project shared info
* Compare to Artifactory Xray
* Compare License Detection
* Create summary of summaries
* Compare Vuln Detection
* Comparison with local images
